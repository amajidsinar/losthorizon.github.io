In late December I was tasked to create a real time object detection system with my friend, Haryo. Since it is a classified project, I couldn’t really say much, but from the project specification we think that we should use YOLOv3.

This chart is the sole raison d’tre 

Since me and haryo like to have total control of our system, we decided to ignore github implementations and start from the basics: reading the paper (and few articles about it, shoutout to Jonathan Hui) and try to implement it with our way.

And this series of post is my personal diary during the journey. At first I planned this to be the first, comprehensive guide to make your own YOLO detector so that people would benefit greatly from this, but I realized that it was me who needed this the most. 

So here it is

## Roadmap
1. Birds eye view. The difference between YOLO, YOLO9000, and YOLOv3
2. Serendipity. How teaming up with Haryo is truly a gift
